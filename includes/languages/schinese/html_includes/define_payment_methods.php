All Credit Cards processing is on payment provider side. Payment Processing use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and 128 bit encryption technologies to enhance security when you visit the secured areas of these sites. SSL is the industry standard protocol for protecting and maintaining the security of message transmissions over the Internet. To ensure your connection to the protected areas of Payment Processing websites is secure, look for either a 'closed lock' or an 'unbroken key' icon located at the bottom right hand side of your browser's task bar. You may also check the Address bar to determine if SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is active by looking at the beginning of the address. If it starts with &quot;https&quot; rather than the standard &quot;http&quot;, then SSL is operating.<br /></p></div><br class="clear" />
